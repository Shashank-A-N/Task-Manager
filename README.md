## 📌 Overview

**PVCS** (Python Version Control System) is a lightweight, minimal version control system written entirely in Python. It allows users to track changes to their files, create snapshots, manage versions, and restore previous states — all from the command line.

Whether you're learning how Git works under the hood or need a custom VCS for academic or research purposes, PVCS offers an educational and functional tool for version tracking.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Initialize and manage version-controlled repositories
- ✅ Track file changes and save snapshots
- ✅ Commit and log versions
- ✅ Restore any previous version
- ✅ CLI-based operations
- ✅ No external dependencies (Pure Python)
