Task Manager - A Modern To-Do Application

---

## 🌟 Overview
Task Manager is a sleek, modern, and fully interactive to-do list application designed with a beautiful "liquid glass" (glassmorphism) aesthetic. It's a single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to run anywhere. All tasks are saved locally in your browser, so your data persists between sessions without needing a backend or database.

This project showcases advanced UI/UX concepts, including custom-built, interactive modals for date and time selection, dynamic DOM manipulation, and a responsive design that works beautifully on all devices.
